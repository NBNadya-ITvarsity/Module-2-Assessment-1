                           <h3>KOALA</h3>
<p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.</p>
<p> Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. </p>
<p>Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. </p>
<p>They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring and between mates.</p>
<p>You will find the koalas at pen D53, near the giraffes.</p>
