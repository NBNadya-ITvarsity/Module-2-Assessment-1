                           <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
<p>Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired.</p>
<p>They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres) in the males, but are always smaller in the females.</p>
<p>They are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small animals.</p>                         
<p>You will find the warthog at pen W30, next to the amphitheatre.</p>
